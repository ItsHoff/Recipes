Waffled French Onion Soup
Author: Morgan
Ingredients
½ stick unsalted butter, divided
1 teaspoon olive oil
2 large white onions, sliced
1 can beef broth
2 tablespoons white wine (optional)
¼ teaspoon dried thyme
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 teaspoons cornstarch, plus more if needed
2 tubes Pillsbury Crescent Recipe Creations Seamless Dough Sheet (or other puff pastry sheets)
8 ounces gruyere cheese, shredded
Chopped chives, for topping
Directions
1. Melt 2 tablespoons butter with the olive oil in a medium­sized pot over medium heat. Add the onions and stir
regularly until they are caramel in color and sweet.
2. Add the beef broth, white wine (if using) and thyme. Season with salt and pepper, and simmer for 30 minutes.
3. Remove the onion soup from the heat. Strain out the caramelized onions and reserve the liquid. Return the
liquid to the heat.
4. In a small bowl, mix together 2 teaspoons of cornstarch and 2 teaspoons of water to make a slurry. Whisk the
slurry into the broth and heat over medium­low heat until thickened, stirring often.
5. As the broth thickens, make the waffles. Cut circles of pastry dough using a cookie cutter of your desired
size. Place one pastry dough circle on the center of the waffle iron. Top with a generous amount of cheese
and caramelized onions, packing it together as much as possible so that the waffles have plenty of filling.
Place a second dough circle on top and press down the sides to prevent the fillings from oozing out. Sprinkle
a small amount of gruyere cheese on top to create the browned, burnt cheese bits.
6. Close the waffle iron and cook until golden brown and no longer doughy. Remove from the iron and repeat until
no ingredients remain.
7. Drizzle with the warm onion gravy and sprinkle with chopped chives.
