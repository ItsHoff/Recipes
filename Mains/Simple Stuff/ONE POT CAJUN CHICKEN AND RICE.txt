ONE POT CAJUN CHICKEN AND RICE
Prep Time: 10 mins Cook Time: 35 mins Yield: 5-6 servings
INGREDIENTS
3 tablespoons oil
5-6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 small white onion, diced
3 stalks celery, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
14 ounces andouille sausage, sliced
2 cups brown long grain rice
3 1/2 cups chicken broth
Kosher salt, to taste
1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley
Lime wedges, to serve
INSTRUCTIONS
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high.
Rub the chicken thighs all over with the cajun seasoning. Cook until the spices begin to blacken and the thighs are cooked through. Transfer the chicken thighs to a plate and set aside.
Add the garlic, onion, celery, bell pepper, and andouille sausage to the pan and saute until the vegetables have softened slightly, about 5 minutes. Stir in the rice and chicken broth.
Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cover. Cook for 20 minutes, or until the liquid has absorbed. Return the chicken to the pan and cover again until the chicken is heated through and the rice is fully cooked, about 5 additional minutes. Season with Kosher salt, to taste.
Sprinkle with fresh parsley and serve warm with lime wedges.
