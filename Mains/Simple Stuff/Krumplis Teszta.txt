Krumplis Teszta

    6-8 potatoes, peeled and cubed
    2 Tbsp lard
    Smoked sausage, cut into small pieces (we use our own sausage for this...every winter we case and smoke our own, but any kind will work, it's really just the smokey flavor you want. The recipe calls for 5 slices, but you do what you want, man...I almost always put in about half a links worth)
    1 onion, diced (sweet works best in my opinion)
    2 C chicken or beef broth (whatever you have on hand. I've always used these two, but I imagine a ham stock would work just as well)
    2 Tbsp paprika (doesn't matter the type. Hot, smoked, or regular paprika all work equally well. Amount is estimated, add it to your personal taste level)
    Egg Noodles (the smaller the egg noodle the better. I find little square egg noodles at Marcs, but I'm at work and can't remember who makes them, otherwise I'd link them)

Melt the lard in a large pan with high sides. Add the potatoes, cooking until starting to soften. Add in the onion, cook until softened. Add sausage. Let that cook down a bit so the sausage renders a little bit. Add in your stock, enough to cover the potatoes. You may need to add more down the road, depending on how much the potatoes absorb. Add your paprika and stir. Cover and reduce heat to simmer. Cook until potatoes are soft, but not mushy (so you can easily stab through them with a fork). In a separate pot, cook the noodles according to package direction, drain, and add to potato mixture. Add salt and pepper to taste.

You can always cook the noodles in with the potatoes if you're feeling lazy. That's just one less pot to wash. It doesn't impact the taste at all.
