French Onion Grilled Cheese

serves 1

1/2 tbsp. unsalted butter, plus more for buttering bread
1/2 medium onion, thinly sliced
2 slices Natureâ€™s Own Thick Sliced Multigrain
2 slices Swiss cheese
2 slices Provolone cheese
optional: warm beef broth for dipping
Melt 1/2 tbsp. of unsalted butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Add onion slices and cook for around 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until caramelized. Set aside.

Butter each slice of bread. Place one slice of bread, buttered side down, on a large skillet. Add one slice of the Swiss cheese and one slice of Provolone cheese to bread, and top with the caramelized onions.

Top the onions with the two remaining cheese slices, and the last remaining slice of bread, buttered side up. Cook sandwich until golden brown, and then flip. The sandwich is done when both sides are golden brown, and the cheese has melted.

Cut in half and serve immediately with optional beef broth.
