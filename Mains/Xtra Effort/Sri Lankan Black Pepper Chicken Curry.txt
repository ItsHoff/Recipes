Sri Lankan Black Pepper Chicken Curry
Author: Dan Toombs
Ingredients
1 kilo ( 2lbs.) chicken thighs cut into bite sized pieces
2 tablespoon ghee
1 cinnamon stick
5 green cardamom pods
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
3 cloves
2 bay leaves
20 curry leaves (or so)
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
2 onions ­ finely chopped
2 tablespoons garlic and ginger paste
1 onion ­ thinly sliced
2 sweet green peppers
3 green chilli peppers (whichever you prefer)
20 cherry tomatoes ­ quartered
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1 teaspoon red chilli powder
1­ 2 tablespoons finely ground black pepper (This should be to taste)
1 tablespoon soy sauce
400ml ( 1½ cups) coconut milk
Salt to taste
Instructions
1. Heat the ghee in a large wok or pan until bubbling hot.
2. Add the cinnamon, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, cloves, bay leaves and curry leaves.
3. When the mustard seeds begin to pop, add the chopped onions and stir it all up.
4. Fry the onions until they begin to brown and then add the green chillies, black pepper and other ground spices.
5. Spoon in the garlic and ginger paste and soy sauce. Stir to combine.
6. Add the sliced green peppers, tomatoes and sliced onions and cover the pot.
7. Cook for five to ten minutes. As you do this the chicken and vegetables will release moisture. A pinch of salt will help in this process.
8. To finish, pour in the coconut milk and simmer until you are happy. You can either serve this with a lot of sauce or reduce it down.
9. Season with salt and perhaps a little more black pepper to taste.
