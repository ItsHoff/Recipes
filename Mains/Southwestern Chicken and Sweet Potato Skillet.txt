Author: Morgan
Ingredients
2 tablespoon oil, divided
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1" pieces
1 large sweet potato, peeled and cubed
4 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon paprika
½ teaspoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon black pepper
¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper
10 ounces frozen corn, thawed
2 bell peppers, stemmed, seeded, and chopped
4 green onions, sliced, divided
1 (10 ounce) can rotel tomatoes with green chiles
1½ cups low sodium chicken stock
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
¼ cup fresh cilantro, plus more to top
1½ cups shredded monterrey jack cheese
Guacamole, to top, optional
Directions
1. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken to the skillet cook until
browned but not cooked through, about 6­8 minutes. Remove the chicken from heat and set aside.
2. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the skillet. Once hot, add in the sweet potato and brown, about 12­14
minutes.
3. Add the garlic, seasonings, corn, bell peppers, and half of the green onions to the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes,
stirring. Add in the tomatoes with green chiles and chicken stock. Return the chicken to the skillet and stir
well to combine.
4. Cook for 5 more minutes. In a small bowl, mix together the cornstarch and a tablespoon of water to form a
slurry. Add the cornstarch to the liquid in the skillet, mix in the black beans and cilantro, and cook until the
sauce has thickened and the black beans are warmed.
5. Set oven to broil. Top the skillet with the shredded cheese and broil until the cheese is melted and just
beginning to turn golden in spots.
6. Sprinkle the skillet with additional green onion and cilantro. Serve warm and top with guacamole, if desired.
