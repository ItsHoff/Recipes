Rigatoni with Easy Vodka Sauce
Published February 2018
Ingredients
Kosher salt
1 medium onion
4 garlic cloves
4 oz. Parmesan cheese
2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
1 4.5-oz. tube double-concentrated tomato paste
½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
2 oz. vodka
¾ cup heavy cream
1 lb. rigatoni
Basil leaves (for serving)

Steps
1. Fill a stock pot or other large pot three-quarters full with water and heat over high. Toss in
a handful of salt and bring to a boil while you do your other prep.
2. Peel and finely chop 1 onion.
3. Firmly smash 4 garlic cloves with the flat side of a chef’s knife and remove peel.
4. Grate 4 oz. Parmesan on the smallest holes of the box grater.
5. Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a Dutch oven over medium (position it next to pot of water). Add onion
and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, just until onion is starting to brown around the
edges, 5–7 minutes.
6. Add entire 4.5-oz. tube tomato paste and ½ tsp. red pepper flakes and stir until paste
evenly coats onion. Continue to cook, stirring often, until paste is deep red and starting to
brown on bottom of pot, 5–7 minutes.
7. Add 2 oz. vodka to deglaze pan and stir to incorporate, scraping bottom of pot. Reduce
heat to low.
8. Using a heatproof glass measuring cup, scoop about ¼ cup boiling water from pot, then
add ¾ cup heavy cream to measuring cup (this brings up the temperature of the cream
so it won’t break when you add it to the pot).
