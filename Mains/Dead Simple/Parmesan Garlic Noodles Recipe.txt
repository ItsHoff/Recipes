Parmesan Garlic Noodles Recipe

Serves 2-3 | Prep Time: 15 Minutes | Cook Time: 5 Minutes

Ingredients:

8 oz spaghetti or linguine
1/2 (60 g) stick butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
5 cloves garlic, finely minced
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
Salt, to taste
1 tablespoon grated Cheddar cheese, for garnishing
Chopped parsley, for garnishing

Method:

Prepare the noodles per the package instructions to al dente. Drained and set aside.

Heat up a skillet and add the butter and olive oil. Saute the garlic until slightly brown and aromatic. Toss in the noodles, stir to combine well. Add salt to taste.

Turn off the heat and stir in the Parmesan cheese. Garnish with some Cheddar cheese and parsley. Serve immediately.

Cookâ€™s Note:

To add some Asian flair to the taste of the noodles, sometimes I use oyster sauce instead of salt to flavor the noodles.
