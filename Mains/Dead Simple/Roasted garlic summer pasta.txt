Roast 2 heads of garlic and 1 carton grape tomatoes, all drizzled with olive oil, at 175 C for 40 minutes or so. Mash it all up with a fork. Add to penne (or any other type of pasta, I guess) with a handful or two of good shredded parmesan.

- add balsamic to the olive oil when you roast the garlic and tomatoes
