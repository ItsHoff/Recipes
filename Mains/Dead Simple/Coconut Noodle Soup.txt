5-Ingredient Coconut Noodle Soup
5 mins 10 mins 15 mins
Servings: 2 to 4

Ingredients
3 cups vegetable broth
1 small sweet potato, cut into bite-sized cubes (yields about 1 cup)
1 teaspoon ginger, minced
1 pack House Foods shirataki noodles I used the fettucini but the other types work, too, drained and rinsed with tap water
1 cup coconut milk
1/4 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
1 tablespoon chopped cilantro for garnish (Optional)

Instructions
1. Add vegetable broth to a medium-sized pot. Heat over medium-high heat.
2. Cut sweet potato and ginger, then add it to the soup.
3. When the soup starts to boil, turn to medium-low heat and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the sweet
potato turns tender.
4. Add the shirataki noodles, coconut milk, and salt. Cook for 1 minute, until the soup and noodles are
just heated through. Taste the broth and adjust seasoning by adding more salt, if needed.
5. Garnish the soup with cilantro, if using. Serve hot as a light main dish or a side.
