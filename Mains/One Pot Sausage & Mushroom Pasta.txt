One Pot Sausage & Mushroom Pasta
Total Cost: $9.23
Cost Per Serving: $1.15
Serves: 8
Ingredients
2 Tbsp olive oil $0.32
2-3 links Italian sausage $1.99
2 cloves garlic $0.16
1 small onion $0.52
8 oz. button mushrooms $1.99
1 (28oz.) can crushed tomatoes $1.00
1 tsp dried basil $0.10
1 tsp dried oregano $0.10
4 cups vegetable broth $0.52*
1 lb. rigatoni $1.89
Â¼ cup parmesan $0.41
handful fresh parsley (optional) $0.23
Instructions
1. Add the olive oil and sausage links to a large pot and cook over medium heat until they are browned
on the outside and firm enough to slice into rounds. Remove the sausage from the pot with tongs,
slice into rounds, then return them to the pot and cook for a few minutes more, or until fully browned.
2. While the sausage is cooking, slice or mince the garlic and slice or dice the onion (depending on how
big you want your pieces). Slice the mushrooms.
3. Once the sausage is browned, add the crushed tomatoes, onion, garlic, mushrooms, basil, and
oregano to the pot. Stir to combine and to dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the pot.
4. Add the vegetable broth and pasta, then stir to combine. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to
high, and bring it to a rapid boil. As soon as it reaches a full boil, give it a stir, replace the lid, turn the heat down to low. Let the pot simmer on low for 15 minutes. Stir it every five minutes or so while it's
simmering. Make sure it's simmering (bubbling) the whole time. If it is not, turn the heat up slightly.
5. After 15 minutes of simmering, the pasta should be tender and most of the liquid should be absorbed.
If there is still too much liquid, let it simmer without a lid for a couple more minutes. Stir in the
parmesan and top with fresh chopped parsley, if desired.
Notes
*I use Better Than Bouillon brand soup base to make my broth.
