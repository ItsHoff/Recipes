Ingredients

    1 loaf hearty bread (about 1 lb. total)* $1.69
    2 Tbsp butter $0.12
    2 cloves garlic, minced $0.16
    8 oz. mushrooms $1.29
    pinch salt and pepper
    8 oz. chopped kale (6-8 cups) $2.13
    8 oz. Swiss cheese, shredded $1.69
    6 large eggs $1.50
    1.5 cups whole milk $0.50
    1 Tbsp Dijon mustard $0.09
    1/8 tsp ground nutmeg $0.02
    1/4 tsp salt $0.02

Instructions

    The day before, prepare the strata so it can refrigerate over night. Preheat the oven to 300ºF. Tear the bread into 1/2 to 1-inch chunks and spread them out over a large baking sheet. Bake the bread chunks in the oven for 20 minutes, stirring once half-way through, to partially dry the bread.

    Meanwhile, slice the mushrooms, then add them to a large skillet with the butter, minced garlic, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté the mushrooms over medium heat until they release all their moisture and begin to brown (about 5-7 minutes). 

    Remove the cooked mushrooms from the skillet and add the kale in its place along with a couple tablespoons of water (this helps the kale wilt). Sauté the kale until wilted (2-3 minutes).

    Coat the inside of a 3 quart casserole dish with butter or non-stick spray. Layer half of the dry bread chunks in the bottom of the dish, then top with half of the mushrooms, half of the kale, and half of the Swiss. Wiggle the ingredients down between the bread chunks a bit, then repeat all the layers a second time.

    In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, Dijon, nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp salt. Pour the egg mixture over the prepared strata, making sure to drizzle over every surface of the strata, rather than just pouring in one spot. Cover the strata and refrigerate for 8-24 hours.

    The next day, allow the strata to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Bake the casserole for 50 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160ºF and the top is deeply golden brown.

    Let the strata rest for 10 minutes, then slice into six pieces and serve!

Recipe Notes

*I don't suggest using soft, fluffy bread for this recipe. Use a strong bread that can stand up to soaking in liquid overnight. Any artisan loaf will work, and if you can get sourdough, that will add even more flavor!
