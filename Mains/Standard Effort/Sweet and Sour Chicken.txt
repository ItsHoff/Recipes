Sweet and Sour Chicken
Author: Morgan
Ingredients
1.5 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into chunks
Kosher salt
⅓ cup plus 2 tablespoons cornstarch, divided
1 cup water
½ cup granulated sugar
⅓ cup rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar
¼ cup ketchup
2 teaspoons low sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons oil
1 green bell pepper, cut into chunks
1 red bell pepper, cut into chunks
½ large white onion, cut into chunks
1 (6 oz) can pineapple chunks with juice
Rice, to serve
Green onion, sliced, to serve
Directions
1. Season the chicken chunks with salt and place into a large freezer bag. Pour in ⅓ cup of cornstarch and seal the freezer bag. Shake well and toss to coat the chicken pieces in an even, light coat of cornstarch. Set aside.
2. In a medium­sized bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons cornstarch, 1 cup cold water, the sugar, vinegar, ketchup, and soy sauce. Set aside.
3. In a large skillet over medium­high heat, heat the oil. Using tongs, remove the chicken pieces from the freezer bag, shake off any excess cornstarch, and place the chicken in the skillet. Brown the chicken on all sides, and then remove the chicken from the pan and set aside on a plate.
4. Add the onion and pepper chunks to the skillet and cook until slightly softened, about 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in the sauce mixture and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the canned pineapple chunks and juice. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Add the chicken back to the skillet and cook together for 5 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thickened.
5. Serve warm over rice and garnish with green onion.
