Creamy Garlic Chicken Recipe

Serves 3-4 | Prep Time: 5 Mins | Cook Time: 15 Mins
Inspired by: Seasons and Suppers

Ingredients:

20 oz chicken thighs, skin-on and deboned
2 tablespoons olive oil
15-20 cloves garlic
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/3 cup white wine
1/4 cup plain yogurt
3 sprigs thyme, optional
Salt, to taste
Ground black pepper
Pinch of paprika

Method:

Season the chicken with a little salt and pepper.

Heat up a skillet (cast-iron skillet preferred) on medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Pan-fry the chicken until both surfaces become crispy or nicely browned. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.

Discard the chicken fat from the skillet. Add the remaining olive oil and saute the garlic until light brown. Add the chicken back into the skillet, follow by the chicken broth, white wine and yogurt. Lower the heat and let simmer. Add the thymes (if using), salt, pepper and paprika. Reduce the sauce a little bit. Remove from heat and serve immediately.

Cookâ€™s Note:

You may finish the dish by broiling it in oven for about 1 minute, to char and crisp up the chicken skin.
