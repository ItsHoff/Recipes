Instructions
1. To prepare the Berbere, mix all the spices and set aside.
2. Time to cook the lentils. Heat a pan (or Instant Pot, or a Stovetop Pressure Cooker). Add oil.
3. Once it's hot, add onion and saute for 2-3 minutes or until translucent.
4. Add ginger and garlic. Stir and cook for 3-4 minutes.
5. Add the tomatoes, berbere spice, and salt. Mix well and cook for 6-8 minutes or until the tomatoes are wilted and the mixture thickens.
6. Now add the lentils, potatoes, and 2 cups of water. Give it a good stir and close the lid.
7. For Instant Pot, cook for 15 minutes on High settings. For stovetop pressure cooker, cook until 8-10 whistles on medium-high heat. For a normal pan, cook for 20-25 minutes on low-medium heat.
8. That's it, your Ethiopian Lentil Stew is ready! Garnish with freshly chopped cilantro and serve over rice, quinoa, or naan.
