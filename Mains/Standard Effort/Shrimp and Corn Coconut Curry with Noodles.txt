Author: Emily Clifton ­ Nerds with Knives
Ingredients
12 ounces rice noodles (340g) (vermicelli)
1 pound shrimp (454g), peeled and deveined
2 ears corn, kernels removed from the cob (or about 1½­2 cups frozen corn)
1 tablespoon curry powder (mild or spicy)
2­3 tablespoons thai red curry paste
2 tablespoons coconut or vegetable oil
1 medium onion, chopped (about ⅔ cup)
3 teaspoons garlic, grated (about 3 medium cloves)
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated (about a 2 inch piece)
Salt and pepper
Zest and juice of 1 lime
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 can (14 oz) coconut milk
1­2 tablespoons honey (more or less, to taste)
¾ cup mixed cilantro, basil and/or mint leaves, for garnish
1 lime, quartered, for garnish
Instructions
1. Cook rice noodles according to package directions, then drain and rinse well with cool water. Set aside. Keep a pot of boiling water on stove for reheating noodles later.
2. Melt coconut oil in a wide skillet over medium heat. Add onions and cook until softened, about 5 to 8 minutes.  Add curry powder, curry paste, garlic and ginger and stir everything together, cook for 2 minutes more.
3. Add lime zest and juice, honey, fish sauce and coconut milk. Add corn and stir to combine. Simmer gently for 5 minutes, stirring every so often until the sauce thickens slightly.
4. Season shrimp with salt and pepper, add to pan and simmer gently until shrimp are just cooked, 3 to 4 minutes. The shrimp should be just barely opaque where it’s thickest.
5. Dip noodles briefly in hot water to reheat, then drain and divide among bowls. Spoon shrimp and sauce over each serving. Garnish with cilantro, basil and mint leaves and a wedge of lime.
