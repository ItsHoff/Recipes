Author: Emily Clifton ­ Nerds with Knives
Ingredients
1 pound boneless skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 1½ inch chunks
1 pound fresh Chinese wheat noodles or dried spaghetti
1 tablespoon garlic, minced or grated
3 scallions, white and green parts, thinly sliced
½ cup smooth peanut butter
¼ cup soy sauce
2 teaspoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
4 tablespoons sesame oil, divided
2 tablespoons light brown sugar, packed
1 teaspoon fresh ginger, grated
1½ teaspoons chili­garlic sauce (Sambal) or Sriracha
⅓ cup roasted peanuts, roughly chopped
Cilantro, for garnish
Sliced limes, for garnish
Instructions
1. In a medium size bowl whisk together the peanut butter, soy sauce, fish sauce, rice vinegar, 2 tablespoons
sesame oil, ginger, garlic, brown sugar and chili sauce.
2. In a separate bowl, add the chicken and toss with 2 tablespoons of the peanut sauce mixture. Let marinate at
least 10 minutes and up to a day. Heat a grill, grill pan or heavy frying pan over medium­high heat. Cook the
chicken until browned and just done, 3­4 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the pan and let it rest for
5 minutes.
3. Cook the noodles in large pot of salted boiling water to al dente, according to package instructions. Reserve 1
cup of the cooking liquid, then drain well and transfer to a large serving bowl. Toss with the remaining 2
tablespoons sesame oil until evenly coated. Pour the remaining sauce over the noodles and mix well until fully
combined. If it's too thick, thin it with a few tablespoons of the reserved noodle cooking water. Add the
scallions and grilled chicken and toss again.
