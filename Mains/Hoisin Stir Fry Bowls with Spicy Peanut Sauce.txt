Instructions
1. Mix the spicy peanut sauce first to allow the flavors time to blend. In a small bowl, combine the peanut
butter, sriracha, soy sauce, brown sugar, and grated fresh ginger (use a small holed­cheese grater to grate
about 1 tsp). Stir in one tablespoon of hot water at a time until the sauce is thin enough to drizzle. Set the
sauce aside.
2. Mince the garlic and grate another teaspoon of fresh ginger. Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet over
medium flame. Add the garlic and ginger to the hot skillet and sauté for about one minute, or just until the
garlic is softened. Add the pork and continue to sauté until the pork is cooked through and crumbled (about
five minutes).
3. While the pork is cooking, rinse the mushrooms then chop them into small pieces. Once the pork is cooked
through, add the chopped mushrooms and continue to sauté until the mushrooms have wilted and released
all their moisture (about five minutes).
4. While the mushrooms are cooking, peel the carrot then shred it using a large­holed cheese grater. Finely
dice the red bell pepper. Once the mushrooms have cooked down, add the shredded carrot, diced bell
pepper, hoisin sauce, toasted sesame oil, and soy sauce to the skillet. Stir and cook until everything is
coated in sauce and heated through. (The amount of soy sauce needed may vary depending on the brand of
hoisin sauce used. Start with ½ Tbsp and add more to taste).
5. To build the bowls, start with one cup cooked rice, then add ¾­1 cup of the meat and vegetable mixture.
Sprinkle a few sliced green onions on top, then drizzle 1­2 Tbsp of the spicy peanut sauce over everything.
Finish with about 1 Tbsp of the chopped peanuts.
Notes
*Short on time? This bowl will still be great with just the crushed peanuts and a drizzle of sriracha.
**neutral cooking oils are mild in flavor, like canola, peanut, or grapeseed.
