Serves 2-4   Approx time: 20   Difficulty: super easy

Ingredients

1 handful Szechuan peppercorns, crushed
2 x 350 g higher-welfare pork fillets, thinly sliced
2 teaspoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons sunflower oil
2 tablespoons freshly grated ginger
1-3 fresh red chillies, deseeded and chopped, to taste
125 g oyster mushrooms, wiped and torn
125 g shiitake mushrooms, wiped and halved
1 red pepper, deseeded and chopped
1 bunch spring onions, trimmed and sliced
200 g pak choi, chopped
2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped
300 g bean sprouts
300 g medium egg noodles, cooked
2 teaspoons fish sauce
6 tablespoons oyster sauce
1 small bunch fresh coriander, leaves chopped

Method

Rub the crushed peppercorns into the pork slices. Heat your wok and a frying pan to make them as hot as you can. Pour the sesame and sunflower oils into the hot wok and fry the ginger, chilli and mushrooms for a minute until slightly coloured. Throw in the pepper, spring onions, pak choi, garlic and bean sprouts and stir-fry until wilted. Add the noodles, fish and oyster sauces, the coriander leaves and the stock. Stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes until the noodles are steaming hot. Taste and season with soy sauce. 

Meanwhile, drizzle a little sunflower oil into the hot frying pan and fry the pork for 2 minutes on each side or until cooked through and golden. Serve with the stir-fried noodles.
