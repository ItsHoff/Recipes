For the Pork Bulgogi:

overnight.
2. In a large pan over medium­high heat, cook the pork until it is well done and browned.
For the Kimchi Slaw:
1. In a large bowl or plastic container, combine all of the kimchi slaw ingredients. Toss, cover, and then shake to
make sure everything is coated. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving, or overnight.
For the Wasabi Mayo:
1. Combine all ingredients in small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
Put it all together!:
1. Generously pile the pork on the sliders, top with a bit of the Kimchi Slaw, and spread the wasabi mayo on the
top bun. Serve with Sriracha on the side for those who like theirs extra spicy!
