Spring Pasta with Ramps, Peas and Pancetta
Author: Emily Clifton ­ Nerds with Knives
A versatile pasta dish that combines spring vegetables (ramps and peas) with crisp pancetta in a light, creamy sauce.
Ingredients
½ pound ramps, cleaned and cut into 1 inch pieces* (bulbs and leaves separated)
5 oz pancetta or bacon, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
¼ cup dry white wine
¾ cup heavy cream
1¼ cups fresh or frozen peas (no need to thaw, if frozen but blanch, if fresh)
Kosher salt and cracked black pepper
10 ounces dried linguine pasta
Shaved or grated Parmesan cheese, optional
Instructions
1. Set a large pot of salted water on to boil. Cook linguine according to package directions until al dente;reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid before draining pasta.
2. While pasta is cooking, make the sauce. In a large skillet over medium­high heat, cook the pancetta until crisp and lightly browned. With a slotted spoon, remove to a plate lined with a paper towel.
3. Remove excess fat from the pan if there is more than 2 tablespoons. Add ramp bulbs (if you have them) and sauté for 3­4 minutes until soft. Add garlic and cook 30 sec longer (careful not to burn the garlic). Add wine to skillet. Return to heat and cook for 1 minute. Add cream. Cook and stir occasionally for 6 to 8 minutes until sauce coats the back of a wooden spoon. Add peas and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until peas are just tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
4. When pasta is done, add it to the pan along with ¼-1/2 cup reserved pasta water. Toss until pasta is fully coated. Add more pasta water a little at a time, if needed. Transfer to serving bowl and sprinkle with shaved Parmesan, if using.

Notes
*If you can’t find ramps, substitute 2 small leeks or spring onions, cleaned and thinly sliced, plus 1 clove garlic, minced
