Ingredients
For the chicken:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 cup all purpose flour
1 tablespoon paprika
½ tablespoon salt
½ tablespoon black pepper
½ tablespoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 eggs
½ cup milk
Oil, to fry
For the sauce:
8 cloves garlic, chopped
1 cup hot sauce
1 teaspoon granulated sugar
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
½ teaspoon black pepper
5 tablespoons butter
Chives, chopped, to garnish
Directions
1. Place the chicken breasts between pieces of plastic wrap and pound out to an even thickness. Set aside.
2. In a wide, shallow bowl, mix together the flour, paprika, salt, oregano, and peppers. In a separate shallow bowl, beat the eggs with ½ cup milk.
3. Line a baking sheet with foil and place a rack on top. Heat ½ inch of oil in a heavy­bottomed, high­walled pan over medium­high heat.
4. Dip the chicken breasts into the flour mixture, turning and patting to coat well, then transfer to the egg wash.  Then, dip the chicken once more in the flour mixture, Set aside, and continue until all of the chicken breasts have been coated.
5. Once the oil is hot, reduce the heat to medium and add in 2 of the chicken breasts. Fry for 5 minutes per side, or until the coating is brown and crunchy and the chicken is cooked through. Carefully transfer the cooked chicken to the rack to cool and dab off excess oil from the top with a paper towel.
6. In a separate small pot, combine the first 5 sauce ingredients over medium heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and mix in the butter. Let simmer for 3 minutes, and then let it cool. Pour the sauce into a shallow, wide dish. Dip the chicken into the sauce, and place it back on the rack. Spoon the chopped garlic from the sauce over the top of the chicken, and top with chopped chives. Serve warm.
