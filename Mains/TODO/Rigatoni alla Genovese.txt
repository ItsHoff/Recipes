Rigatoni alla Genovese

Ingredients
Yellow onions, finely chopped 1 kg
Ground beef or pork 300-400g
Chopped garlic 2tbsps
Rigatoni 225g
Shaved parmesan cheese plus more for garnish 3/4 cup
Salt
Pepper
Fresh parsley for garnish
Table cream 1/4 cup
Dry White wine 1/4 cup - 1/2 cup
Olive oil

Steps
liberally coat the bottom of a heavy bottom sauce pot with olive oil add all the onions, coat with more olive oil and a liberal amount of salt. Stir to combine.
Cover and heat on medium for 40 minutes, stirring every 10-20 minutes
If the onions are completely translucent and a good amount of liquid has appeared, stir in the meat and garlic. Stir hard and long to completely break apart the meat and combine it with the onions.
Cover and simmer on very low for 2-3 hours, stirring every 30 mins or so.
Deglaze the pot with the wine, stir to combine and turn the heat to medium-low to cook off the wine while the pasta cooks.
Bring a pot of salted water to boil, cook the rigatoni til el dente. As soon as you've added the rigatoni to the water reduce sauce heat back to very low and stir the cream into the sauce and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
Preheat your broiler after you add the rigatoni to the water. Drain the pasta and add it to the sauce, stirring to combine.
Spoon the pasta onto plates and cover each with 1/4 cup shaved parmesan
Place each plate under the broiler for 30-45 seconds, remove and garnish with parsley.
Serve with extra parmesan on the side. I make food then I take pictures of it.
