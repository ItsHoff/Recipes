Miso­Butter Chicken with Garlic Pan Sauce
Author: Emily Clifton ­ Nerds with Knives
Chicken baked in a sweet and salty miso­butter coating and a delicious garlic pan sauce.
Ingredients
8 skin­on, bone­in chicken thighs, approximately 2½ to 3 pounds
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
¹∕๜ cup white miso
3 tablespoons maple syrup
1 inch piece ginger, grated
8 garlic cloves, unpeeled but lightly smashed
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
Black pepper, to taste
2 scallions, finely sliced, for garnish
2 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds, for garnish
Instructions
1. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Combine butter, miso, maple syrup, rice vinegar, ginger and black pepper in a large bowl and mix until well combined.
2. Add chicken to the bowl and massage the miso­butter mixture all over it. Gently lift up the skin of each piece and, using your fingers, rub some miso butter under the skin. Place the chicken in a single layer in a roasting pan or heavy oven­proof skillet, add the garlic cloves and place it in the oven. Roast for 30 to 40 minutes, basting the chicken once or twice, until the skin is golden brown and crisp, and the internal temperature of the meat is 160 to 165 degrees. If the chicken is cooked before it’s brown enough, place it under the broiler for a minute or two. Watch carefully or it can burn.
3. Remove the garlic skins and mash them into the pan drippings. Sprinkle chicken with sesame seeds and scallions and a spoonful or two of the garlic pan sauce.
