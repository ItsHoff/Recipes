Pan fried tofu with spicy sauce
Ingredients

    half package of tofu (about 7 oz: 200 grams)
    soy sauce
    hot pepper flakes
    sugar
    green onion
    garlic
    sesame oil
    roasted sesame seeds

Directions

    Slice the tofu into 10 bite size pieces (Â¼ inch thick rectangles). Towel off each piece with a paper towel.
    Heat a pan and add 1 to 2 tbs of vegetable oil.
    Add the tofu and lower the heat. Cook over low heat for about 5 to 7 minutes until the bottoms of the tofu pieces turn golden brown.
    Turn over each piece and cook another 5 minutes.
    Transfer the cooked tofu to a serving plate.
    Make yangnyeomjang (seasoning sauce) in a small bowl by mixing these ingredients:
        1 clove of minced garlic
        1 chopped green onion
        1 ts hot pepper flakes
        1 ts sugar (or honey)
        1 tbs soy sauce
        1 ts sesame oil

    If you make this with a whole package of tofu, double the sauce ingredients
    Spoon the sauce evenly over the tofu, and sprinkle some roasted sesame seeds over top just before serving.
    Serve as a side dish with rice.
