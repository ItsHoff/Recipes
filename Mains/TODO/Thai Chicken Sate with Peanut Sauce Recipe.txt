Ingredients:

2 pounds skinless and boneless chicken breast, sliced 1 inch wide x 4-5 inches length
20 wooden skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes
1/2 cucumber, sliced

Marinade:

2 tablespoons fish sauce
1.5 tablespoons minced garlic
2.5 teaspoons sweet soy sauce
2.5 teaspoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons Masaman curry paste
1/3 cup coconut milk

Peanut Sauce:

1 teaspoon masaman curry paste
2 tablespoons fish sauce
3 tablespoons tamarind juice
3 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
1.5 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon paprika powder
1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 cups coconut milk
1/2 cup crushed peanuts

Method:

Slice the chicken breast across grain with at least 1 inch wide each piece. Mix in the Marinade and make sure all pieces are well coated. Marinate the meat for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.

Prepare the peanut sauce by adding all the Peanut Sauce ingredients in a 2 quart sauce pan. Mix well and cook on medium heat. Stir the sauce while cooking. Turn off the heat when the sauce is slightly thickened. It takes about 10-15 minutes.

Take out the marinated chicken from the refrigerator. Insert the wooden skewers through the meat lengthwise. Grill the Sate for 4 minutes on each side or until desired tenderness.

Serve with Peanut Sauce and some sliced cucumber.

Cookâ€™s Note:

You can find Masaman curry paste in a pack at any Asian Grocery Stores.
