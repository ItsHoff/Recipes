One Pot Pasta Bolognese
Author: Morgan
Ingredients
4 slices bacon, chopped
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste
¼ teaspoon red chili flakes, plus more to taste
1.5 lb ground chuck
¼ cup tomato paste
28 ounces crushed tomatoes
3 cups reduced sodium chicken stock (or 2 cups chicken stock and 1 cup wine)
4 sprigs thyme
1 pound tagliatelle or spaghetti
¼ cup milk
½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese
¼ cup thinly sliced fresh basil leaves
Directions
1. In a dutch oven or large skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until lightly crisped. Mix in the onion, celery, and garlic, and season liberally with salt and pepper. Mix in ¼ teaspoon red chili flakes, adding slightly more if you prefer more heat in your sauce. Cook together until the onion has softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Add in the ground chuck. Cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, for 5 minutes or until browned all over. Once browned, stir in the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, chicken stock, and thyme.
3. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 5 minutes. Then, uncover, remove the thyme sprigs, stir the pasta in, and continue to simmer for 15 minutes or until the pasta is cooked through and the sauce has thickened, stirring occasionally.
4. Stir in the milk, parmesan cheese, and shredded basil, and adjust the seasonings to taste. Serve with additional basil, to garnish.
