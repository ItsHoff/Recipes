Brooklyn Chicken Noodle Soup

Serves 6-8 / Total time 1 hour 20 minutes (including prep)

1 large white onion, chopped

2 tbsp minced garlic (4-5 good sized cloves)

2 tbsp olive oil

1.5 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-2 inch pieces

1 cup carrots, sliced into coins

2 stalks celery, sliced

2 medium yukon gold potatoes, skin on, diced

1 tsp kosher salt, or to taste

1/2 tsp freshly ground pepper, or to taste

1 tbsp chicken bouillon

1 bay leaf

1 tsp fresh thyme (or 1/2 tsp dried)

1/2 tsp fresh rosemary (or 1/4 tsp dried)

2 cups extra wide egg noodles (about 3 ounces dried noodles), cooked al dente

1/2 cup frozen peas

In a very large pot (5qt minimum), heat the oil over medium heat and add the onion and garlic. Cook, turning occasionally, until softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken and lightly brown (donâ€™t cook all the way), 4-5 minutes. Add in the carrots, celery, and potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the carrots and celery have softened slightly and the potatoes have begun to absorb the liquid in the pot, 6-7 minutes. Add the thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf, and cook until fragrant.

Combine the bouillon with 6 cups of water and stir to dissolve. Add more water if you prefer a thinner soup. Pour the broth into the pot and bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low, stir, and cover. Cook for 35-40 minutes and season to taste with more salt and pepper if necessary.

In the last 8-10 minutes of cooking, add in the egg noodles and frozen peas. Cook until the peas are softened but still bright and perky, and the noodles are soft enough for you. Remember that they will continue to absorb the broth and soften more. Remove the bay leaf, give it a good stir, and taste.

Serve warm with saltines or french bread. Enjoy. 

Cool tip: cook the noodles separately, and keep them separate until you're ready to eat. Only combine as much as you want to eat in your serving bowl. This prevents them from absorbing too much broth and getting all mushy. Especially useful if you're making a large batch to eat throughout the week.
