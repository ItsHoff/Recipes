Spicy Mushroom Larb
2 servings
Don’t even think about tossing, stirring, or shaking that pan until the mushrooms are golden brown and crisp. You want to achieve that flavorful texture before incorporating the additional aromatics. This recipe is part of the 2019 Feel Good Food Plan, our ten-day plan for starting the year off right.
Ingredients

    ¼ cup roasted, skinless peanuts
    4 Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided
    12 oz. shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, quartered
    3 scallions, thinly sliced
    2 garlic cloves, finely grated
    1 1" piece ginger, peeled, finely grated
    Kosher salt
    1 medium shallot, thinly sliced into rings, rinsed, drained
    1 red chile, such as Holland, Fresno, or Thai, thinly sliced
    1 cup mint leaves, torn if large
    1 Tbsp. fish sauce
    ¼ head of green cabbage, halved crosswise, leaves separated
    Lime wedges (for serving)

Recipe Preparation

    Coarsely chop or crush peanuts into small pieces; set aside.

    Heat 3 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook, undisturbed, until bottom sides are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Toss and continue to cook, tossing occasionally and reducing heat as needed to avoid scorching, until golden brown all over, about 4 minutes more. Add scallions, garlic, and ginger, followed by remaining 1 Tbsp. oil, and cook, stirring often, until softened and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat; season lightly with salt. Mix in shallot, chile, mint, fish sauce, and half of peanuts. Taste and season with more salt if needed.

    Transfer larb to a large bowl. Serve with cabbage, lime wedges, and remaining peanuts alongside.
