Feel-Better Chicken and Rice Soup

2–4 servings
If you want this take on classic chicken soup to have a similar consistency to congee, add 10–15 minutes to the cooking time so that it can become nice and thick. This recipe is part of the 2019 Feel Good Food Plan, our ten-day plan for starting the year off right.

Ingredients

    ¾ lb. skinless, boneless chicken thighs
    ⅓ cup jasmine rice, rinsed
    4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
    1 2" piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced
    Kosher salt
    2 small sweet potatoes, unpeeled, cut into ½"-thick rounds
    2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
    2 Tbsp. soy sauce
    ½ bunch cilantro, coarsely chopped
    Freshly ground black pepper

Recipe Preparation

    Bring chicken, rice, garlic, ginger, and 5 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add a big pinch of salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until rice has swelled and chicken is firm, 10–12 minutes.

    Add potatoes to pan and cook over medium-low heat, still uncovered and stirring occasionally, until soup is thickened and potatoes and rice are tender, 15–20 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to a bowl and shred with 2 forks, then return to pot. Stir in lemon juice and soy sauce; taste soup and season with salt if needed.

    Divide soup among bowls. Top with cilantro and lots of black pepper.

    Do Ahead: Soup (without cilantro) can be made 3 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill. Reheat over medium-low, adding water to thin as needed.
