Spicy Sesame-Chili Noodles with Chicken
Author: Morgan
Ingredients
12 ounces Asian egg noodles or spaghettini
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 pound ground lean chicken
⅓ cup tahini paste
4 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tablespoons grated ginger
¼ cup low­sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
2 tablespoons sriracha
1 cup chicken stock, or as needed
⅓ cup toasted sesame seeds
⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional
2 sprigs green onion, chopped
Directions
1. Cook the spaghettini according to package directions. Drain and set aside.
2. Meanwhile, heat the sesame oil in a skillet over medium­high heat. Add the ground chicken and cook until cooked through and no longer pink, 5­6 minutes. As the chicken cooks, break it up into very small pieces­­ you want these pieces to be able to cling to the noodles when served. Transfer the cooked chicken and spaghettini to a large bowl and cover to keep warm.
3. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the tahini, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, and sriracha. Process until well­combined. With the processor running, slowly stream in the chicken stock until the mixture reaches the consistency of a creamy salad dressing.
4. While the chicken and pasta are still warm, toss them with the tahini sauce mixture. Sprinkle in the sesame seeds and red pepper flakes and mix well. Top with green onion and serve warm or at room temperature.
