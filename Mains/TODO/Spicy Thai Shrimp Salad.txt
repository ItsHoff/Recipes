Spicy Thai Shrimp Salad
Author: Emily Clifton ­ Nerds with Knives
A simple, healthy Thai shrimp salad with an authentic sour­savory­spicy­sweet combination of fresh lime juice, fish sauce and chili paste, showered with fresh herbs and crunchy roasted peanuts.
Ingredients
5 tablespoons lime juice (from about 3 limes)
2 teaspoons lime zest, finely grated
3 tablespoons fish sauce
1 ½ tablespoons sugar
1 ­ 2 tablespoons sambal, (or use chili­garlic paste or Sriracha)
1 pound large shrimp, shelled and de­veined
1 large shallot, thinly sliced
1 cup cilantro, leaves and tender stems (or basil), roughly chopped
½ cup mint leaves, roughly chopped
½ cup roasted, unsalted peanuts, roughly chopped
Jasmine rice or rice noodles, for serving
Instructions
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
2. In a large bowl, combine lime juice, lime zest, fish sauce, sugar, and chili paste. Taste, and adjust with any of the ingredients. It should taste quite sour, but also a little salty, spicy and sweet.
3. Turn heat off and poach the shrimp in the water until just cooked through, 2­3 minutes. Be careful not to overcook. Drain well.
4. Add the warm shrimp to the sauce and toss well. Add the shallot, cilantro and mint leaves. Toss, and transfer to a serving bowl. Scatter over the peanuts and garnish with a few more herbs. Serve immediately with hot rice or rice noodles.
