Chinese Base
Basic Ingredients

1/4 t Table Salt (kosher/sea salt if you're cooking steak)
1/4 t Sugar
2 T White pepper *
2 T Garlic Powder *
2.5 T Soy Sauce
Coat with Cooking Oil with high enough smoke point for stir fry (Canola is what I use usually)
A bit of Corn starch around one teaspoonful per 250g of meat to hold the solid seasoning together with the liquid.

*these ingredients you can use liberally since it's very difficult to put too much in

Optional Ingredients

Grab a small bowl and mix some water with table spoon or more of cornstarch if you want to get a thick sauce. Make sure to mix it with your finger to get rid of any clumps that form.
A bit of paprika if you want a little kick
1 T Shaoxing cooking wine for shrimp beef and chicken to give it aroma. You can replace Shaoxing with sake if it's not available in your area.
Minced garlic for more intense flavor
