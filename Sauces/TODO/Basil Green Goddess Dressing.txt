Basil Green Goddess Dressing
Author: Emily Clifton ­ Nerds with Knives
A creamy, herb­packed salad dressing that's also light and refreshing. Our version uses basil in place of parsley,
adding a sweet, summery note.
Ingredients
½ cup mayonnaise
3 scallions, white and green parts, chopped
½ cup fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped
2 tablespoons chives, roughly chopped
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (1½ lemons)
1 teaspoons garlic, chopped (1 small clove)
3 anchovy fillets packed in oil, drained, chopped (or 2 teaspoon anchovy paste)
½ teaspoon coarse kosher salt
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
½ cup Greek yogurt or sour cream
Instructions
1. Add the mayonnaise, scallions, basil, chives, lemon juice, garlic, anchovies, salt and pepper to a blender or
food processor and blend until smooth. Add the sour cream and process just until blended. (If not using right
away, refrigerate until ready to use.)
