GRILLED PEACH SALSA
This salsa lets people know you aren’t fucking around with your snack spread. The perfect combo between savory and sweet, this is one salsa that makes it hard to not double-dip.
Makes enough for 4 to 6, about 3 1⁄2 cups

From: Thug Kitchen

INGREDIENTS
6 peaches (about 3 pounds)

1⁄2 teaspoon oil*

1 to 2 serrano peppers, minced

1⁄2 medium red onion, chopped (about 2⁄3 cup)

1 medium tomato, chopped

Juice of 2 limes (about 1⁄4 cup)

1⁄4 teaspoon salt

Handful of cilantro

INSTRUCTIONS
Cut the peaches into wedges no thicker than an inch. You can leave the skin on because everybody needs more fiber in their motherfucking diet. You should get around 12 wedges out of each peach. Throw the cut-up peaches in a large bowl with the oil and mix them all together.

Bring your grill to a medium-high heat. Place the peaches on there for 45 seconds or so on each side. You don’t need to cook them; you just want some char marks on there because that looks pro as fuck. Grilling the peaches also caramelizes their natural sugars, making them sweeter.

When the all peaches are grilled, let them cool for a couple minutes while you chop everything else up. When the peaches have cooled enough to handle, chop them up into salsa-appropriate-size pieces and then mix everything together. Let this all chill together for at least 30 minutes and then serve.
