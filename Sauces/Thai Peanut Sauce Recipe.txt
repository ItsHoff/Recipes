Thai Peanut Sauce Recipe

Makes 1 cup | Prep Time: 10 Minutes | Cook Time: 5 Minutes

Ingredients:

1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
3/4 cup coconut milk
2 tablespoons Thai red curry paste
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon sugar or to taste
2 tablespoons ground peanut
Salt to taste

Pan-Fried Turmeric Chicken

Ingredients:

Two (2) chicken thighs, skin-on, boneless
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
Salt
Black Pepper

Method:

Add all the ingredients in the saucepan. Use a whisk to quickly whisk all the ingredients together before transferring to a stove top to heat up on low heat. Continue to whisk the peanut sauce until all ingredients are well-combined.

As soon as the peanut sauce starts to simmer and bubble, turn off the heat. (If you like the sauce more watery, you may add a little water to dilute it during the cooking process.) Transfer off the heat and top with some ground peanut. The Thai peanut sauce is now ready. You can keep the left over in the fridge for a week without losing the fresh taste. To make the chicken, marinate both sides of the chicken thighs with turmeric powder, salt and black pepper, for 15 minutes. Pan fry the chicken with some oil until both sides are nicely brown and slightly “crispy,” and the meat is cooked through. Slice the chicken into pieces and drizzle with the peanut sauce and garnish with some chopped cilantro leaves. Serve immediately with rice and with fresh salad of your choice.
