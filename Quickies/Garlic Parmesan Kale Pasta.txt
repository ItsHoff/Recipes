Garlic Parmesan Kale Pasta
Total Cost: $3.89
Cost Per Serving: $0.97
Serves: 4
Ingredients
½ lb. (or one large bunch) kale $1.25
½ lb. (8 oz.) whole wheat angel hair pasta $0.89
2 Tbsp olive oil $0.32
2 Tbsp butter $0.30
2 cloves garlic, minced $0.16
salt & pepper $0.05
¼ cup grated Parmesan $0.87
pinch red pepper flakes (optional) $0.05
Instructions
1. Tear the kale leaves from the woody stems and rinse well in a colander under cool, running water. Allow the
kale to drain. Cut the kale into thin strips or small pieces.
2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Break the pasta in half, add it to the boiling water, and cook according to
the package directions. Drain the pasta in a colander.
3. While the pasta is cooking, add the olive oil, butter, and minced garlic to another large pot or skillet. Cook
over medium heat for 2­3 minutes, or until the garlic is soft and fragrant. Add the kale and continue to
sauté until the kale has wilted and has turned a deep green color (about 5­7 minutes). Turn the heat off.
4. Add the drained pasta to the pot with the sautéed kale. Toss the pasta and kale together. Allow them to cool
to the point that steam is no longer rising from the pot. You want the pasta warm, but not hot enough to
melt the Parmesan.
5. Season the pasta and kale with salt and freshly cracked pepper to your liking. Add the grated Parmesan
cheese and toss to coat. Add a pinch of red pepper flakes over top if desired.
