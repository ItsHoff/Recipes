Brie-Rosemary-Honey Flammkuchen
Dough:

2 Tbsp Olive Oil
125 ml Water
Sprinkle of Salt
250g White Flour
Combine all ingredients and knead until no longer sticky. Roll out until thin on a baking tray.

Toppings:

100g Creme fraiche
100g Sour Cream (10% fat)
2 Onions
200g Brie (Caprice des dieux works best!)
3 Tbsp of chopped Rosemary
2 Tbsp liquid Honey
Preheat oven to 250 C (Upper and Lower heat) .

Add salt to the Creme fraiche and Sour Cream and mix to your liking. Spread over the prepared dough. Add the Onions (cut in slices, uncooked), Brie (slices) and Rosemary on top, garnish with a few twigs.

Bake for 8-12 minutes in the middle of the oven. Baking time really depends on how much Cream you put on top (the more you add, the juicier the Flammkuchen becomes, the longer it takes to bake). If after 10 minutes the bottom isn't crunchy, change your oven's settings so that it only heats up from the bottom. Bake another 2-3 minutes, that always works.

In the end, spread a little bit of the honey by drawing quick, big circles over the Flammkuchen. It goes really well with the Rosemary and Brie. Be careful not to add too much, though.

That's it, Enjoy!

Note: If you need any greens to go with it on the side, make a basil & arugula salad with a balsamic vinegar/olive oil, garlic, honey and roasted pine nuts dressing!
