CARAMELIZED ONION AND GARLIC BREAD
Prep Time: 15 mins Cook Time: 40 mins Yield: 1 large loaf
Adapted from Food52

INGREDIENTS
2 heads garlic, cloves smashed and peeled, divided
1/2 small sweet onion, sliced
10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter
1 loaf ciabatta or Italian bread
1/4 cup fresh basil, roughly chopped
1/4 cup fresh parsley, roughly chopped
Kosher salt, to taste
Red pepper flakes, to taste, optional
1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese, plus more to serve
INSTRUCTIONS
In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, combine about 3/4 of the garlic, all of the onion, and all of the butter. Allow the butter to melt, then simmer until the onions have caramelized and the butter is golden, about 30 minutes, stirring often. Let cool for 3-5 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400Â° F.
Add the butter mixture and the remaining fresh garlic to a food processor and pulse until mostly smooth. Add the herbs, salt, and red pepper flakes, and pulse until combined. Be sure not to over-process, you want the herbs to be well-distributed but not processed to a paste. Taste and adjust seasonings as necessary. Set aside.
Halve the ciabatta and place on a large baking sheet. Spread the garlic-onion-herb butter evenly over the cut sides of the bread. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese.
Score the bread into slices, cutting most but not all of the way through, to make it easy to tear apart after baking. Bake the bread until golden brown, 10-15 minutes. Top with a little extra parmesan and serve.
