Focaccia Rolls
Total Cost: $1.20
Cost Per Serving: $0.10
Serves: 12
Ingredients
4 cups all­purpose flour $0.59
½ Tbsp salt $0.05
¼ tsp instant yeast $0.02
2 cups water $0.00
2 Tbsp olive oil $0.24
2 Tbsp Italian seasoning $0.30
Instructions
1. The day before (about 18 hours ahead of time) combine the flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Stir until
well mixed. Add the water, starting with 1.5 cups, and add a little more at a time until the flour forms a
cohesive, wet ball. There should not be any dry flour left on the bottom of the bowl. The total amount of
water you’ll need will vary, but should be between 1.5 to 2 cups. See the photos below for more info.
2. Loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for 16­18 hours to ferment.
3. After 16­18 hours, the dough will look like a large, bubbly mass. Sprinkle with enough flour to be able to
scrape it out of the bowl without it sticking to your hands. Place the dough on a well floured surface. Cut the
dough into 12 pieces. Shape each piece into a small ball. The dough will be quite wet, floppy, and sticky, so
sprinkle liberally with flour as you work.
4. Place the rolls on a baking sheet covered in foil and lightly sprayed with non­stick spray (I used two baking
sheets). Brush the top of each lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle the Italian seasoning over top. Let rise for 30
minutes to one hour or until doubled in size.
5. While the rolls are still rising, preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Once it is fully preheated, place the rolls in
the oven and bake until the surface is a light golden brown (about 25 minutes). Serve warm!
