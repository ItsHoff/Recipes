Cornbread

1c flour (gluten free if needed)
1c yellow cornmeal   
1/2 t salt  
1 t baking soda  
2 t baking powder  
1/3 c brown sugar  
3 T oil  
1 1/2 c buttermilk (or milk + 2T vinegar)
2 eggs
Preheat oven to 220c, pour a liberal amount of oil into cast iron skillet and put in the oven while preheating. Whisk together all listed ingredients in a bowl. Remove pan from oven and pour batter into the hot oil. Watch like a delighted child as the oil instantly starts searing a crust before your very eyes! Put it back in the oven for 20min, check the center with a knife. If it comes out clean, it's done - if not, give it 5 more minutes and try again.
