Homemade Pita Bread

Recipe from Zahav: A World of Israeli Cooking
Ingredients
2½ teaspoons active dry yeast
2 teaspoons sugar
2 cups all­purpose flour
2 cups bread flour
1½ teaspoons kosher salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
Directions
1. Mix together ½ cup water, the yeast, and sugar in a small bowl and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
2. Combine the all­purpose flour, bread flour, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook or a
large mixing bowl. Mix using the stand mixer or a wooden spoon until blended. Add the yeast mixture, another
½ cup of water, and the oil and mix until the dough forms a ball that pulls clear of the sides and bottom of the
bowl. If after a few minutes the mixture doesn't form a ball, add a tablespoon of water at a time until it does.
3. The moment the dough starts to pull clear of the bottom of the bowl, add ½ cup water and continue mixing
until incorporated. The dough should feel tacky when slapped with a clean hand, but it should not stick. If it
sticks, add more flour, a tablespoon at a time.
4. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about an hour.
Alternatively, let it rise in the refrigerator overnight.
5. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F, with a rack in the upper third. Place a baking stone or an inverted baking
sheet in the oven to preheat as well.
6. Roll the dough into 8 balls the size of baseballs. Cover with a cloth and let rise until they are about the size of
softballs.
7. Roll each dough ball to about ¼" thickness with a floured rolling pin on a floured work surface. Place one or
two at a time on the baking stone or baking sheet and bake until puffed and cooked through, about 3 minutes.
Serve immediately, or let cool.
