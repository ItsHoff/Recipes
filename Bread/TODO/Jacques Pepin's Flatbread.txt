ABOUT THIS RECIPE
""The recipe is from Jacques Pepin's TV series, "More Fast Food My Way". It was developed after Pepin visited a Tibetan restaurant and wanted to re-create a pan-cooked flatbread. The advantage of the bread is that it cooks FAST. From start to finish no more than 20 minutes. The bread adapts well to flavor additions such as herbs or mushrooms, rosemary, etc.""

INGREDIENTS
1 1/2 cups flour
1 cup water
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons water
DIRECTIONS
Dump everything (except the 2 tablespoons water) into a bowl and "stir it into a gooey stuff" as Jacques says. The dough will indeed be very wet, gooey, sticky. Stir in any optional ingredients.
Heat a non-stick 10" skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Pour about a tablespoon of olive oil into the pan and then pour in the dough.
Spread into one flat layer with a spoon or spatula. (A little oil on the spoon or spatula helps keep the dough from sticking to it.)
Add a tablespoon or two of water around the outside of the dough where it meets the pan; the object is to create steam to help cook the bread. Cover the pan with a lid and cook 8-10 minutes. Peek at the bottom of the bread about half way through the first 8-10 minutes just to make sure the bottom isn't burning. You want good color, but not charcoal! Adjust the temperature accordingly.
After 8-10 minute flip the bread and re-cover the pan so that it cooks on the other side, 5 minutes.
It tastes best if eaten while warm.
