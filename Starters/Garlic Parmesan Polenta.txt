Garlic Parmesan Polenta
Total Cost: $0.93
Cost Per Serving: $0.16
Serves: 6 slices

Ingredients
1 cup yellow cornmeal $0.21
3.5 cups water $0.00
¾ tsp salt $0,05
2 Tbsp butter $0.26
¼ cup grated Parmesan $0.35
¼ tsp garlic powder
1 Tbsp canola or vegetable oil $0.04

Instructions
1. Add the water and salt to a sauce pot and bring to a boil over high heat.
2. Once boiling, add the polenta while continuously whisking to prevent lumps. Turn the heat down to low
and let simmer until thickened (this will depend on the type of cornmeal you have­­mine only took about
two minutes).
3. Once thickened, stir in the butter, grated Parmesan, and garlic powder until smooth. Serve warm, or
spread the mixture out into a square or round casserole dish and let cool in the refrigerator, uncovered,
until solid.
4. Slice the solid polenta. Add a small amount of canola or vegetable oil to a non­stick skillet and warm over
medium heat. Once the oil is hot and glistening, but not smoking, add the polenta slices and cook until
golden on each side. Add more oil as needed to fry the remaining slices.

Notes
Only fry as many slices as you plan to eat at the moment. The slices are best when fried just before serving.
