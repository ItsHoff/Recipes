Clementine Cake
INGREDIENTS
Clementines
3 cups of sugar
450g of cake flour
1 ½ tsp salt
¾ tsp of baking powder
¾ tsp baking soda
1 ½ cup of butter
487.5g of sugar
6 large eggs
3 tsp vanilla extract
¾ cup clementine juice
Zest of 4 clementines
1 ¼ cup buttermilk
Nonstick spray
Parchment paper
Clementine Glaze

150g sifted powdered sugar
30-45 ml of clementine juice
Zest of 1 clementine
METHOD
Start by slicing 3 clementines for candying. Make sure you slice them very thin.
Poach the clementines in boiling water for 1 minute, and then shock them by transferring them to a bowl of ice water.
Combine 3 cups of sugar and 1 ½ cups of water in a large saucepan. Add a little squeeze of clementine juice and bring to a sweet gentle simmer. Add clementines in a single layer and simmer for 90 minutes, flipping every 30 minutes.
Once soft and translucent cool on a wire rack, and pour clementine syrup into a measuring cup for later, and set aside.
Weigh out 450g of cake flour to which you’re going to add 1 ½ tsp of salt, ¾ tsp of baking powder, and ¾ tsp of baking soda. Whisk to combine.
Next, add 1 ½ cups of butter to the bowl of a stand mixer, and mix until creamy.
Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add 487.5g of sugar and mix that as well.
Scrape down the sides again, and add 6 large eggs, 3 tsp of vanilla extract, and mix.
Add ¾ cup of clementine juice and the zest of 4 clementines, and mix to combine.
Finally add the dry ingredients and 1 ¼ cups of buttermilk and mix just enough to combine.
Coat a cake pan with nonstick spray and parchment paper. Add the cake batter and cook at 350°F for 45 minutes.
Use a cake tester or a knife to make sure the cake is completely done.
Generously brush down the cake with clementine syrup.
Pour glaze over the top and add candied clementines.
Slice yourself a piece and enjoy.
Clementine Glaze

Combine 150g of sifted powdered sugar, 30-45 ml of clementine juice, and the zest of one clementine. Whisk to combine. (You can use milk instead of juice to look more accurate to the movie, but the juice is better)
