Chocolate chip cookies

I combined the unique aspects of the best recipes I could find, and the result is a cookie that is chewy yet crisp around the edges, melts in your mouth, and has a nice caramel flavor. I make at least 3 per person when taking them to a gathering and still always run out. I'm kinda late to this thread, so if people are interested I'll share the recipe when I get to my computer.
edit: Here it is!
I combined recipes from AllRecipes[1] , serious eats[2] , and the one that I'd previously been tweaking to come up with this, the last chocolate chip cookie recipe I'll ever use:
4-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tsp baking soda
2 cups unsalted butter
1 ice cube
1-1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 (3.4 oz) packages instant vanilla pudding mix
3 large or 4 small eggs
2 tsp vanilla extract
3 cups dark chocolate chunks
Sift together flour and baking soda, and set aside.
Melt butter in saucepan over med high heat. Swirl pan continuously until particles begin to turn golden brown and butter smells nutty (about 5 min). Remove from heat and continue swirling the pan until butter is a rich brown (about 15 seconds). Transfer to a medium bowl, whisk in the ice cube, and put in the refrigerator until completely cooled (about 20 min), whisking occasionally.
When butter has cooled completely, cream butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a mixer with paddle attachment. Beat in instant pudding mix until blended. Stir in eggs and vanilla. Blend in flour mixture. Finally, stir in chocolate chips.
Put batter in refrigerator for at least 1 hour, ideally overnight, or up to 3 days.
Drop rounded spoonfuls onto a greased cookie sheet. Bake at 350 until edges are golden brown, approximately 10-12 minutes.
A couple of notes...
the sea salt garnish mentioned in serious eats[3] is a nice touch, but not to everyone's taste. I do it if I'm making cookies for home but not if I'm taking them somewhere to share.
obviously cooking time will vary depending on your oven, but I bake my first batch for 13 min, second one for 12 min, and any subsequent ones for 11 min.
