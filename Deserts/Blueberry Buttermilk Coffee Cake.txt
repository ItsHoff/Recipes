COFFEE CAKE
2 cups all­purpose flour $0.33
1 Tbsp baking powder $0.24
¾ tsp baking soda $0.02
¼ tsp salt $0.01
½ cup white sugar $0.16
2 large eggs $0.55
1 cup buttermilk $0.60
¼ cup melted butter $0.36
½ cup blueberries (frozen or fresh) $0.60
Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350ºF. In a small bowl, combine the ingredients for the streusel topping (flour, brown
sugar, softened butter, and cinnamon) until they create a uniform, crumbly topping. Set the topping aside.
2. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt for the coffee cake batter. In a
separate bowl, whisk together the white sugar, eggs, buttermilk, and melted butter until smooth. Pour the
bowl of wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients, and stir just until a thick, fluffy batter forms (do not
over stir).
3. Coat an 8x8 inch baking dish (or similar size) with nonstick spray. Spread the batter into the dish. Sprinkle
the blueberries over top, then push them down into the batter with your fingers. Sprinkle the streusel
topping over the top.
4. Bake the coffee cake in the fully preheated 350ºF oven for 40­45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.
Slice into eight pieces, then serve.
