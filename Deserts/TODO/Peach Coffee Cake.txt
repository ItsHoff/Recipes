Peach Coffee Cake
for twelve

This is adapted from the apple cake
often served during Rosh Hashanah.
It’s simple and wonderful for dessert,
with tea, or as a sweet breakfast. The
juicy peaches add a ton of flavor to
this simple cake. If you buy peaches in
season, the cost can be quite reasonable.

6 peaches, pitted and cut into 8 slices each
1 tsp cinnamon
½ lemon, juiced
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tsp baking powder
½ lb unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature
1 1 / 3 cups brown sugar
1 / 8 tsp salt
2 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla

Turn your oven to 350 F.
Using the paper wrapping from the butter, lightly
butter an 8” x 11” glass baking dish or 9” springform
pan. Any shape will do so long as it is large enough.
This cake doubles in size when it bakes.
In a large bowl, mix the peach slices, lemon juice, and
cinnamon together with your hands, making sure the
peaches are well coated in cinnamon.
In a medium bowl, stir the flour with the baking
powder, getting rid of any lumps.
In another large bowl, beat the butter, brown sugar,
and salt, either with a wooden spoon or an electric
mixer. Stop when the mixture is fluffy and has slightly
lightened in color. Add the vanilla, then the eggs one at a
time, fully mixing in the first before adding the second.
If using an electric mixer, switch to a wooden spoon
and add the flour mixture into the butter mixture,
gently incorporating it until it’s smooth. The batter will
be quite thick.
Spread half the batter over the bottom of the buttered
pan. Evenly distribute 12 of the peach slices overtop.
(There should be 24 in total.) Spread the other half of
the batter over the peaches, then top with the remaining
peaches. Sprinkle with a tablespoon or so of sugar and
place the cake in the oven.
Bake for 1 hour or until a knife inserted into the center
comes out clean.
