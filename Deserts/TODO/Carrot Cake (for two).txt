Carrot Cake (for two)
Total Cost: $1.30
Cost Per Serving: $0.65
Serves: 2
Ingredients
CAKE
? cup all­purpose flour $0.05
½ tsp baking powder $0.04
¼ tsp salt $0.02
½ tsp cinnamon $0.05
¼ tsp nutmeg $0.03
? tsp ground ginger (optional) $0.02
1 large egg (yolk only) $0.19
¼ cup brown sugar $0.12
¼ tsp vanilla extract $0.07
2 Tbsp vegetable oil $0.08
1 medium carrot $0.14
FROSTING
1 oz. cream cheese $0.22
1 Tbsp butter $0.07
¼ tsp vanilla extract $0.07
½ cup powdered sugar $0.13
Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Stir until evenly combined.
2. Peel the carrot and use a large holed cheese grater to shred it into a separate bowl. Add the egg yolk, brown sugar, vanilla, and vegetable oil to the shredded carrot. Whisk these ingredients together with a fork until evenly combined.
3. Pour the bowl of dry ingredients into the bowl of wet ingredients and stir just until evenly combined.
4. Coat two small (6oz.) ramekins with non­stick spray, then divide the batter between the two. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet to make them easier to transport in and out of the oven. Bake the cakes for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
5. While the cakes are baking, place the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract in a bowl and allow them to come to room temperature. Once room temperature and soft, whisk with a fork until smooth. Stir in the powdered sugar a little at a time until it is all incorporated.
6. Allow the cakes to cool before spreading the cream cheese frosting over top (otherwise it will melt and slide off). Enjoy!

Notes
If you don't have small ramekins, these can be baked in a muffin tin.
