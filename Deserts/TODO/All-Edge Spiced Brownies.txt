All­Edge Spiced Brownies
Total Cost: $1.71
Cost Per Serving: $0.29
Serves: 6
Ingredients
½ cup flour $0.07
⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder $0.21
1 cup granulated sugar $0.15
⅛ tsp salt $0.01
⅛ tsp cayenne pepper $0.02
⅛ tsp baking powder $0.01
¼ tsp cinnamon $0.02
2 large eggs $0.55
1 tsp vanilla $0.28
4 Tbsp butter, melted $0.36
1 tsp butter (for greasing the muffin tin) $0.03
Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Coat the inside of 6 cups of a muffin tin with butter.
2. In a mixing bowl, stir together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, salt, cayenne, baking powder, and cinnamon until evenly combined.
3. Cut the butter into chunks, then microwave until melted (about 30 seconds). Let the butter cool slightly while you add the eggs and vanilla to the bowl with the dry ingredients (don't stir them in just yet). Finally, pour the melted butter into the bowl and then stir until a thick, even brownie batter has formed.
4. Divide the batter between the greased cups, then bake for 20 minutes, or until the centers are puffed and the edges are browned. Remove the brownies from the oven and allow to cool (or eat warm!).
