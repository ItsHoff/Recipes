Pecan Pie
CRUST:
1 2/3 C. AP flour
1/3 C. cornstarch
6 oz. unsalted butter, frozen and shredded with a box grater
2 oz. vegetable shortening or lard
1 t. kosher salt (or 1/2 t. ordinary table salt)
2 T. white sugar
1/3 or so cold water
Mix all ingredients in large bowl. Use large fork or hands to gently and quickly toss together the dry ingredient and butter. Slowly add the water just until the dough is cohesive. Shape into disc, wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 hour to overnight.
FILLING:
3/4 C. dark corn syrup
1/4 C. blackstrap molasses
1/2 C. white sugar
1/2 C. light brown sugar, lightly packed
2 T. unsalted butter, melted and cooled
3 grade A large eggs, lightly beaten
1 t. vanilla extract (real vanilla extract, please. If you paid less than $5 for the bottle, chances are it ain't vanilla.) Or use one vanilla bean innards.
8 oz. pecans, plain or toasted, just not salted. Traditionally pecan halves are used here, but I find pecan pieces more affordable and easier to slice through. And when it's covered in ice cream or whipped cream, who is going to notice or care?
1 oz. bourbon (completely optional, but a good addition)
Roll out dough and place it into 9 inch pie dish. (I often use my cast iron skillet for this.) Preheat oven to 350*.
Mix all the ingredient for the filling together, adding the pecans last. Carefully pour into pie shell and slide into oven. Bake 60 - 70 minutes, until pie reaches about 200* at the center. Cover the crust edges with kitchen foil if they start to get too brown.
VIE: (Very Important Edit) You may want to place a large cookie sheet covered in foil under the pie because it sometimes can bubble over just a little, and cleaning super burnt pecan filling out of your oven is no fun at all. Best served with nice vanilla ice cream or homemade whipped cream.
