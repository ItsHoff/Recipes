rice pancakes
Total Cost: $0.42
Cost Per Serving: $0.21
Serves: 2
Ingredients
1½ cups cooked rice $0.12
1 large egg $0.15
½ tsp vanilla extract $0.05
½ tsp cinnamon $0.05
¼ tsp salt $0.05
Instructions
1. Pre­heat a non­stick skillet over medium­high heat. While the skillet is warming, mix together the rice, egg, vanilla, cinnamon and salt in a bowl until well combined.
2. Using a measuring cup (about ⅓ cup), scoop some of the rice mixture onto the hot skillet. Using your spatula, smoosh the ball of rice down until it is a circle and about ½ inch thick. Repeat until your skillet is full.
3. The pancakes need to cook for about 5 minutes on each side to give the egg enough time to set and hold the rice together. Flipping them too early or too many times will result in loose fried rice rather than rice pancakes. When you flip the pancakes, make sure to get the entire pancake onto the spatula before attempting to flip. Plate the pancakes up when they are golden brown on both sides and solid in texture.
4. Dress the pancakes with your favorite pancake toppings and enjoy!
