Brown Sugar & Rum Coconut Creme Pie
INGREDIENTS
1 pie crust shell, cooked until lightly golden, and cooled.
Filling:

1 cup sweetened flaked coconut
1/2 cup flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup dark brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 cups whole milk
1 cup heavy cream
3-5 teaspoons dark rum
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Whipped Topping:

1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
DIRECTIONS
MAKE THE FILLING
Heat a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add coconut flakes and cook, stirring constantly, until flakes are golden brown, or about 5 minutes. Remove coconut flakes from the skillet and set aside.

In a medium saucepan, whisk together flour, salt, sugars, eggs, milk, and heavy cream. Continue whisking constantly over low heat until mixture is well thickened, about 15-20 minutes.

Remove saucepan from heat. Add vanilla extract and rum. I used 4 teaspoons of rum, but you can add more or less according to your preference. Stir in 3/4 cup of the toasted coconut.

Pour mixture into pie shell and chill in the fridge.

MAKE THE WHIPPED TOPPING
Combine heavy cream and 2 tablespoons granulated sugar in a large bowl and use a mixer with the whisk attachment to whisk until cream reaches stiff peaks. Refrigerate until ready to use.

Once the pie filling is cool to the touch and has firmed a bit, spread whipped cream on the pie. Sprinkle remaining toasted coconut flakes over the topping, and continue cooling the pie in the fridge until the filling has set, about 3 hours, or overnight.

You can use store bought frozen whipped cream instead of homemade if desired. To do so, let frozen whipped cream thaw in the fridge before using, then spread it on the pie according to the recipe.
Itâ€™s easier to make the whipped cream if your mixing bowl and whisk are very cold. I always put my bowl and whisk in the freezer for at least 15 minutes before making whipped cream.
