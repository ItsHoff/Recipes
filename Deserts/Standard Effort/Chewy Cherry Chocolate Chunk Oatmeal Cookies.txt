Chewy Cherry Chocolate Chunk Oatmeal Cookies
Author: Morgan
Ingredients
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1¼ cups dried cherries
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
1 cup dark brown sugar
½ cup white sugar
1½ cups all­purpose flour
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon cornstarch
3 cup rolled oats
6 ounces dark chocolate, roughly chopped
Coarse sea salt, for topping, optional
Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside
2. In a medium­sized bowl, beat the eggs. Then, mix in the vanilla extract and the dried cherries. Allow to sit for an hour.
3. In a large bowl, use a hand mixer to beat together the butter and sugars until fluffy. Add in the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, kosher salt, and cornstarch, and continue to whisk until well­distributed and crumbs form. Pour in the egg and cherry mixture, oats, and chocolate. Mix until well­combined, ensuring no large, dry chunks remain.
4. Roll about ¼ cup's worth of the dough between your hands to form balls just slightly larger than a golf ball. Place 6 cookie dough balls on a baking sheet at a time, evenly spaced. Bake for 14 minutes, then press the tops lightly with a spatula to flatten them slightly. Continue to bake until beginning to crisp around the edges, about 4­6 more minutes. The cookies should still be very soft when you remove them from the oven. Sprinkle them lightly with sea salt, if desired.
5. Allow the cookies to cool and firm up on the first baking sheet as you put the next batch of cookies into the oven on your second baking sheet. When the second batch of cookies comes out, remove the first batch of cooled cookies from their baking sheet and repeat until all of the cookies have been baked.
6. Store in an airtight container until ready to serve.
