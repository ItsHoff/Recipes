Servings: 24 cookies
Ingredients
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour $0.33
1 1/4 tsp ground, dried ginger $0.15
1/4 tsp ground cloves $0.05
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg $0.05
1 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder $0.04
1 tsp baking soda $0.05
8 Tbsp 1 stick butter $0.80
1 Tbsp grated fresh ginger $0.24
1/2 cup brown sugar $0.16
1/2 cup dark molasses $1.10
1/4 cup white sugar $0.04
4 oz. semi-sweet baking chocolate $1.32
Instructions
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: flour, ground ginger, cloves, nutmeg, cocoa powder, and baking soda.
2. Peel the fresh ginger and grate it into a separate, medium-sized bowl (grate using a small holed cheese grater). Add the butter (room temperature) and beat with an electric mixer until it’s light and fluffy.
3. Add the brown sugar to the butter mixture and beat again until fluffy. Add the molasses and beat until fluffy. Add half of the flour mixture and beat until well incorporated. Add the second half of the flour mixture and beat until fully incorporated. If the dough is too dry and won’t come completely together, add one tablespoon of water.
4. Roughly chop the semi-sweet chocolate into small pieces. Stir it into the dough. Transfer the dough to a sheet of plastic wrap. Wrap it tightly and refrigerate for about one hour or until firm.
5. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Place the white sugar in a small bowl. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and divide it into 24 pieces. Working quickly, roll each piece of dough into a ball and coat it in white sugar. Place the sugar coated dough balls on a baking sheet covered with parchment (12 per baking sheet). Bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes or until the surface looks cracked.
