Peanut Butter S'mores Pots
Total Cost: $1.22
Cost Per Serving: $0.61 each
Serves: 2足4
Ingredients
3 graham crackers $0.13
2 Tbsp butter $0.25
1 Tbsp sugar $0.05
2 Tbsp peanut butter (optional) $0.21
3 Tbsp milk chocolate chips $0.18
10 large marshmallows $0.40
Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place three whole graham crackers (rectangles, not the square half) and
place them in a zip top bag. Use a rolling pin to crush the graham crackers into crumbs.
2. Melt the butter in a medium bowl. Once melted, stir in the sugar and graham cracker crumbs. Stir the
mixture until it looks like damp, coarse sand. Divide the mixture between two 8oz. ramekins and use the
back of a spoon to pack the mixture into a solid layer.
3. Drop about 1 Tbsp of peanut butter onto each graham cracker crust, followed by a sprinkle of chocolate
chips (1 to 1.5 Tbsp for each ramekin). Arrange the marshmallows in a single layer in the ramekin. Use
enough marshmallows so that they are touching each other, but not packed in tight. They will spread as
they melt.
4. Bake the s'mores pots for 15 minutes, or until the marshmallows are puffy and light golden brown. Serve
hot (use a pot holder or wrap the ramekin in a towel because it will be hot!).
