Peanut Butter Chocolate Chickpea Bars
Author: Morgan
Ingredients
1 cup dried chickpeas
2 teaspoons baking soda
⅔ cup natural peanut butter
¾ cup organic brown sugar (or date sugar)
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 teaspoon cornstarch
½ teaspoon salt
¾ cup dark chocolate chips, divided (or vegan chocolate chips)
Directions
1. Rinse the chickpeas and then place in a large bowl. Cover with 2" of water and stir in 1 teaspoon of the baking
soda. Let sit overnight, or for at least 6 hours. Drain and rinse.
2. Transfer the chickpeas to a medium­sized pot and cover them with 4" of water. Add the remaining teaspoon of
baking soda and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium high and let cook at a vigorous simmer
until chickpeas are extremely soft and beginning to fall apart, about 1 hour. Drain.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a large loaf pan with parchment paper and set aside.
4. Transfer the warm chickpeas to a food processor and add in all of the remaining ingredients except for the
dark chocolate chips. Process until completely smooth. While the mixture is still warm, add in ½ cup of the
chocolate chips. Mix well to combine, until the chocolate is beginning to melt and swirl into the chickpea
batter.
5. Spoon the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the batter with the back of a spoon. Top with the
remaining chocolate chips. Bake until crackly and browned, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes.
6. Let set for 10 minutes before removing and cutting into bars.
