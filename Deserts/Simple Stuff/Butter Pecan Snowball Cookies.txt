Butter Pecan Snowball Cookies

    Prep Time: 1 hour Cook Time: 15 mins Yield: ~24 cookies 

Ingredients

    2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
    1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened at room temperature
    ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
    1½ cups granulated sugar
    2 teaspoons vanilla extract
    1 teaspoon kosher salt
    1 1/4 cup toasted and finely chopped pecans
    1 cup powdered sugar, for rolling the cookies

Instructions

    Using a handheld mixer, cream the cream cheese and butter together until well blended, creamy and smooth. Beat in the sugar, vanilla extract, and salt, and mix until light and fluffy, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula when necessary.
    On low speed, gradually add flour mixture and mix until just fully incorporated. Once all of the flour is added, mix in the pecans. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
    Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Place powdered’ sugar in a small bowl; set aside.
    Scoop or roll 2 tablespoons of cookie dough per cookie. Roll into balls and place on the baking sheets, at least 2 inches apart. Bake until golden brown along the bottom edges and just beginning to turn golden on top, about 15 minutes.
    Let the cookies cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet. Then roll in powdered sugar. Continue to let cook and roll in powdered sugar again before serving.
