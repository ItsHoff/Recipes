Chorizo, Caramelized Onion, and Poblano Sausage Rolls with Creamy Cilantro Dip
Author: Morgan
Ingredients
2 tablespoons oil
1 medium white onion, chopped
2 poblano peppers, stemmed, seeded, and chopped
½ teaspoon kosher salt
1 pound chorizo sausage, casings removed
1 pound puff pastry, thawed
1 egg, beaten
3 tablespoons black sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or white sesame seeds, to top
1 cup sour cream
1 large handful fresh cilantro
3­4 cloves garlic, minced
¼ cup prepared salsa
Directions
1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and then add in the onion and poblano. Season with ½
teaspoon kosher salt. Saute, stirring occasionally, until the onions have softened and begun to brown around
the edges, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
2. In a large bowl, work together the chorizo sausage meat and the caramelized onions and poblanos. Set aside.
3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut each pastry sheet into
thirds, and place onto the parchment paper.
4. Divide the chorizo mixture evenly amongst the pastry sections, forming a long line down the center of each.
Fold the pastry sheet around the sausage mixture, pinching the edges to seal. Flip the rolls over so that the
seam­side is down.
5. Brush the puff pastry with the beaten egg and sprinkle the sesame seeds on top. Gently slice the sausage
rolls into bite­sized pieces. Separate them, making sure to give each piece plenty of room to puff up as it
cooks.
6. Bake the sausages until golden brown and cooked through, about 30­35 minutes.
7. As the sausage rolls bake, make the dip. In a food processor, combine the sour cream, cilantro, minced
garlic, and salsa. Process until well­combined.
8. Serve the chorizo sausage rolls warm with the creamy cilantro dip.
