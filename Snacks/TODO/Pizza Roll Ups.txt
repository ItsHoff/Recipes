Forget frozen pizza rolls! These Pizza Roll Ups are the perfect last minute appetizer or indulgent snack on busy days! 
Total Cost: $3.71 recipe / $0.93 serving
Servings: 4 2 rolls each
Ingredients

    8 small flour tortillas* $1.03
    40 slices pepperoni $1.32
    4 mozzarella cheese sticks $0.83
    oil, as needed $0.05
    1/2 cup pizza sauce (for dipping) $0.48

Instructions

    Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. Lightly spritz a baking sheet with spray oil or brush a thin layer of your favorite cooking oil onto the baking sheet.

    Stack about 4 tortillas at a time on a plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave for 20-30 seconds, or until they are steamy and pliable. Microwave the second batch when you're ready to roll more.

    Slice each of the mozzarella sticks in half, lengthwise. Place about 5 pepperoni on each tortilla in the bottom 1/3 o the circle, then place the halved mozzarella stick on top. Fold the sides of the tortilla in to cover the ends, then roll them up tight light a burrito.

    Place the tightly rolled Pizza Roll Ups on the baking sheet, seam side down. Leave them slightly apart from one another to allow hot air to surround the rolls. Either spritz the top with spray oil, or brush a thin layer of oil on top of the roll ups.

    Bake the Pizza Roll Ups for 12-15 minutes, or until they're lightly browned and the cheese is just beginning to ooze. Because every oven is different, begin checking on the Pizza Roll Ups at about 10 minutes, then check ever two minutes or so until they're done.

    Serve immediately, with pizza sauce for dipping.

Recipe Notes
*The tortillas I used were about 6". I suggest getting tortillas that are just slightly wider than the length of your mozzarella sticks so you can fold the ends in to hold the melted cheese inside.
