French Onion Beef Sliders For A Crowd
Author: Morgan
Ingredients
8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, divided
2 large sweet onions, sliced
2 pounds ground beef
2 tablespoons beef base (such as Better than Boullion), divided
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, divided
Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste
24 slider buns
12­16 ounces gruyere cheese, chopped
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1 tablespoon fresh thyme
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
Directions
1. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add in the onions and reduce the heat to
medium low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly caramelized, about 25­30 minutes. If the onions start to
look dry or burnt, add a tablespoon of water to the pan.
2. In a large bowl, mix the ground beef with half of the beef base and half of the Worcestershire sauce. Season
generously with salt and pepper.
3. Add the beef to the skillet full of onions. Increase heat to medium­high and brown the beef, breaking it up and
mixing with the onions as you go. Once browned, drain off excess grease.
4. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a large baking sheet. Separate the tops from the bottoms of the
slider buns. Fit the slider bottom buns tightly on the baking sheet.
5. Evenly distribute the beef and onion mixture over the bottom buns. Top with the gruyere cheese. Cover with
the top buns.
6. In a microwave safe bowl, melt the butter with the remaining beef base. Stir in the remaining Worcestershire
sauce and continue to mix until well­combined. Using a pastry brush, brush the beefy butter mixture over the
top buns. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds, thyme, onion powder, and garlic powder.
7. Bake the sliders until the cheese is fully melted and the tops of the rolls are lightly browned, about 20
minutes.
