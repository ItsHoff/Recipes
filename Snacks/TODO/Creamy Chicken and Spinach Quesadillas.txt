Ingredients

    1 boneless skinless chicken breast (about 3/4 lb.) $2.97
    3/4 tsp chili powder $0.05
    1/4 tsp cumin $0.03
    1/8 tsp garlic powder $0.02
    1/4 tsp salt $0.02
    1 Tbsp cooking oil $0.04
    2 cups fresh spinach $0.87
    4 oz. Monterey jack cheese, shredded $1.00
    1/2 cup sour cream $0.35
    4 8-inch flour tortillas $0.96

Instructions

    Place the chicken breast on a cutting board and cover with a piece of plastic wrap. Use a rolling pin or mallet to briefly pound the chicken breast to an even thickness (this should only take 15-20 seconds). This will help it cook quickly and evenly without drying out.
    Combine the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and salt in a small bowl. Sprinkle the spice mixture over both sides of the chicken breast.
    Heat the cooking oil in a skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the chicken breast and cook on each side until cooked through (about 5 minutes each side, use a thermometer to make sure the internal temperature reaches 165ÂºF). Allow the chicken to cool for 5 minutes on a clean cutting board, then chop into tiny pieces.
    While the chicken is cooking, roughly chop the spinach into smaller pieces. Add the chopped chicken, spinach, cheese, and sour cream in a bowl and stir until evenly combined.
    Divide the filling between four tortillas, then fold the tortillas closed. Place the quesadillas (one or two at a time) in a skillet* over medium heat. Cook on each side until the tortillas are brown and crispy, and the filling is melted (3-5 minutes each side). Slice each quesadilla in half and serve.

Notes
*I prefer to cook my quesadillas in a dry skillet, but you can add oil if you prefer a more "fried" texture to your quesadillas.
