Creamy, Homemade Aïoli (Garlicky, Lemony Mayonnaise)
Author: Emily Clifton ­ Nerds with Knives
Ingredients
2 large egg yolks*
½ cup grapeseed or canola oil
½ cup extra­virgin olive oil
2 small garlic cloves, finely grated
½ teaspoon coarse kosher salt, plus more, to taste
Pinch of cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons lemon juice
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
Instructions
1. Drape a kitchen towel over a small saucepan and set a small metal bowl over it (this will hold the bowl in place
so you can whisk and pour at the same time). Whisk egg yolk*, garlic, ¼ tsp. salt, and 2 tsp. water in metal
bowl to blend well.
2. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in grapeseed oil, 1 teaspoonful at a time, until sauce is thickened and
emulsified. Whisking constantly, add olive |oil in a slow, steady stream. Stir in cayenne, paprika and lemon
juice, season with pepper, and more salt, to taste.
Notes
*Raw egg is not recommended for infants, the elderly, pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems. If
you’re concerned, use pasteurized egg yolks instead.
