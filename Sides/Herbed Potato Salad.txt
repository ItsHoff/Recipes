Herbed Potato Salad
Ingredients
3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed
Kosher salt
1 cup mayonnaise
¼ cup greek yogurt
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard
3 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
3 tablespoons chopped dill
3 tablespoons snipped chives
Freshly ground black pepper
½ cup finely chopped red onion (or thinly sliced scallions)
Instructions
1. Put the potatoes and 2 tablespoons of salt in a large saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil. Simmer the
potatoes over moderate heat until tender, about 25-30 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander, then place the
colander with the potatoes over the empty pot and cover with a clean, dry kitchen towel. Allow the potatoes to
steam for 15 to 20 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, yogurt, vinegar, Dijon mustard, whole grain
mustard, herbs, and salt and pepper to taste (approx. ½ -1 tsp of each). Set aside.
3. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them into 2 inch chunks. Place the cut potatoes in a large
bowl. While the potatoes are still warm, pour enough dressing over them to moisten well. Add the celery (if
using) and red onion. Toss well, cover, and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight. Serve cold or at room
temperature.
