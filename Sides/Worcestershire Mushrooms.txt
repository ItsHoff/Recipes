Worcestershire Mushrooms

saute some mushrooms with butter and extra salt, over low heat until they're about cooked through, when they're soft add some minced garlic...

crank the heat to max, add worcestershire sauce right away and let it caramelize over the mushrooms, stirring constantly.

WARNING: if you bring this to a party, you'll never be welcomed back UNLESS you are bringing more of these.
