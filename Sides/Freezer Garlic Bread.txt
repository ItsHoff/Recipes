Homemade Freezer Garlic Bread
Author: Adapted from Love to be in the Kitchen
Total Cost: $2.76
Cost Per Serving: $0.17 per slice (16 total)
Serves: 16 slices
Ingredients
1 stick (8 Tbsp) salted butter $0.80
2 Tbsp olive oil $0.32
4 cloves garlic $0.32
¼ tsp salt $0.02
1 Tbsp dried parsley $0.30
1 16­inch loaf French Bread $1.00
Instructions
1. Allow the butter to come to room temperature. Mince the garlic, then combine it in a small bowl with the
butter, olive oil, salt, and dried parsley. Mix the ingredients together until they form a fairly smooth paste.
2. Cut the bread loaf into 16 one­inch slices. Scoop ½ Tbsp of the butter mixture onto each slice, then spread
it over the surface with a knife. Arrange the slices on a baking sheet and then place them in the freezer for
about 15 minutes to allow the butter to firm up. Once firm, stack the slices two at a time and place in quart
sized freezer bags. Store in the freezer up to three months.
3. To cook the frozen slices of garlic bread, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Once the oven is heated, take as
many slices out of the freezer as you'd like, carefully separate the stacked slices, and place them on a baking
sheet. Bake for 10­12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.*
Notes
*If using a different type of bread, the baking time may change.
