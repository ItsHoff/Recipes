Baked French Fries
Author: Morgan
Ingredients
3 large russet potatoes
1 tablespoon vinegar
1 tablespoon salt, plus more to top
3 tablespoons canola oil
Directions
1. Peel the potatoes and cut into french fry slices, about ⅓" thick.
2. Add the potato pieces, 4 cups of water, a tablespoon of vinegar, and a tablespoon of salt to a pot over high
heat. Bring to a boil and then boil for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain.
3. Meanwhile, drizzle the canola oil onto a rimmed baking sheet and place in the oven. Preheat the oven (with
the baking sheet inside) to 425 degrees F.
4. Place the potato pieces on top of paper towels and press the tops gently with paper towels to soak up excess
water.
5. Once the oven is preheated, carefully pull out the baking sheet and place the potatoes in a single layer on the
sheet. They should immediately start sizzling. Bake for 20 minutes or until lightly golden, gently turning
halfway through with tongs. Remove to a paper­towel­lined plate to absorb any excess oil and sprinkle liberally
with salt.
6. Serve warm
