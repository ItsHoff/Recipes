Neer Dosas
Author: Dan Toombs
Ingredients
320g (2 cups) Basmati rice
140g (1 cup) flaked dehydrated coconut
1 teapsoon salt
Instructions
1. Rinse the rice several times in water.
2. Soak the dehydrated coconut and rice for six hours.
3. Blend the rice and coconut together in enough water to made a batter that is like single cream. If your batter is
too thick, just add a little more water.
4. Heat a nonÂ­stick pan over medium high heat and then spoon some of the batter around the sides. Tip the pan
so that the batter runs into the middle and then top it up with more batter as required to fill the pan. You don't
want these to be too thick.
5. Fry for about three minutes and then flip over to cook the other side. The whole process should only take a few
minutes.
6. Fold the neer dosa in half and then in half again to form a little triangle. Keep warm while you make the rest of
the dosas.
7. Serve with a selection of chutneys.
