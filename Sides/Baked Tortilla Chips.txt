Baked Tortilla Chips
Total Cost: $0.39
Cost Per Serving: $0.20
Serves: 2 (18 chips each)
Ingredients
6 small corn tortillas $0.32
½ Tbsp canola or vegetable oil $0.02
Pinch of salt $0.05
Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Stack the tortillas on top of each other, then cut into six equal sized
wedges.
2. Place the cut tortillas in a large bowl and drizzle the oil over top. Gently toss the tortilla pieces in the oil
until they're all lightly coated.
3. Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper, then spread the tortilla pieces out over the surface so that
they're in a single layer and overlapping as little as possible. Sprinkle lightly with salt.
4. Bake the chips for ten minutes, then gently stir and flip the chips. Return the chips to the oven and bake
until golden brown (3­5 minutes more). Season with salt once more.
5. Allow the chips to cool before serving. They will crisp even further as they cool down.
Notes
NOTE: Every oven is a little different, as are brands of tortillas. Watch the chips closely for color change and
adjust cooking time as needed.
