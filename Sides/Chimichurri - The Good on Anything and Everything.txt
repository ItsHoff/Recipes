Chimichurri: The Good on Anything and Everything
Sauce
Total Cost: $2.20
Serves: ¾ cup
Ingredients
½ cup olive oil $0.83
¼ cup red wine vinegar $0.40
1 cup Italian(flat leaf) parsley, packed $0.35
½ cup fresh cilantro, packed $0.19
3 cloves garlic $0.24
1 tsp dried oregano* $0.10
½ tsp ground cumin $0.05
¼ tsp red pepper flakes $0.02
½ tsp salt $0.02
Instructions
1. Rinse the parsley and cilantro well to remove any dirt or debris. Shake as much water off the leaves as
possible. Place the parsley, cilantro, and the rest of the ingredients in a food processor. Pulse the ingredients
until combined and to your desired texture (coarsely chopped or smooth).
2. Use the chimichurri immediately or refrigerate until ready to use.
3. If you don't own a food processor, simply whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, oregano, cumin, red pepper,
and salt in a bowl. Mince the parsley, cilantro, and garlic. Pour the whisked dressing over the parsley,
cilantro, and garlic, then stir to combine.
Notes
I used dried oregano to save costs, but if you have fresh available 1­2 Tbsp fresh oregano leaves can be used in
place of the dried.
